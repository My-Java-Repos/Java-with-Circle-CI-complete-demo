				## The story

				- A basic web-service is built, tested, and deployed to users.
				
				- The service is one of many dozens or hundreds of microservices working in cooperation (think netflix)
				
				- A single team owns only a handful of services.
				
				(Modern teams using cloud native architecture on k8s platform)

				![netflix UI mocked up wiot potential service boundaries](assets/netflix.png)
				
				--

				## Traditional CCI Story
				- Developer commits code
				- Fix breaking change in unit - fast feedback, optmizations
				- Concurrent packaging of docker while IT tests run
				- Deploy versioned image to docker hub
				- Apply deployment to K8s cluster. 

				![circleci workflow with build, package, apply workflow](assets/cci_workflow.png)

				--

				### But ah Snap!
				
				The service selector in the manifest was bogus, and our beautiful little container is shutoff from the world.

				Users are getting angry error pages!

				![githubs 503 unicorn](assets/gh_angry.png)

				--

				### Adding Release Monitoring 
				- Release agent detects deployment by CCI, Argo, or sun gods (by matching labels [app, version])
				- Release agent monitors metrics from prometheus based on defined metric queries
				- At end of policy time-limit determine if thresholds were met and moves forward, or fails deployment
				- Webhook is fired with details
				- Admins get paged and fix stuff.

				![alerts and metrics image](assets/alerts.png)

				

				--

				### Adding Traffic Shaping
				- Release agent also applies new ingress policy controlling traffic (10% canacy, 90% stable)
				- Vamp agent monitors metrics from prometheus based on defined metric queries
				- At end of policy Vamp determines if thresholds were met and increases rollout, or fails the `release`
				- Webhook is fired with details


				![alerts and metrics image](assets/canary.png)



				--

				### So What?
				- If the application restarts too much  OR
				- Does not respond in time OR
				- Throws too many errors while it does OR
				- X OR X OR x

				Then reset ingress to "Stable" version, and fire webhooks

				- operators don't get pages
				- only a few customers ever notice
				- dev team can keep iterating

				--

				## Webhooks, WHY DO WE NEED EM?
				- Vamp handles ingress & scale based on policies that shape ingress, 
				- but leaves the deployment itself out there (unrouted)
				- Webhooks on Success to:
					- approve CCI apporval job
					- trigger parametized pipeline
				- On failure:
					- call CCI to cleanup bad deployment. 

				--

				## Recap

				- Traditional approach was "hope our non-prod testing was adequate"
					- A _passing_ pipeline in CircleCI is not the same as a _healthy_ application in the wild
						- Invalid config, inadequate scale, integration issues, etc.

				- Modern approach "Ensure our non-prod testing was adequate"
					- We separate `deploy/publish` from `release`
					- We can incrementally expose or rollback new versions

					Java app, in a container, on a cluster ( at night.)<!-- .element: style="color:white;text-shadow: 1 1 3px #000;" -->

					- Java web app with Spring Boot, JDK 17, built with Maven 3.x<!-- .element: style="color:white;text-shadow: 1 1 3px #000;" -->
					- Dockerized with Google Jib (daemonless)<!-- .element: style="color:white;text-shadow: 1 1 3px #000;" -->
					- Deployed to k8s cluster in AWS EKS<!-- .element: style="color:white;text-shadow: 1 1 3px #000;" -->
					- With a non-admin K8s Service Account<!-- .element: style="color:white;text-shadow: 1 1 3px #000;" -->
					- Cluster using Contour ingress and Prometheus Monitoring<!-- .element: style="color:white;text-shadow: 1 1 3px #000;" -->

					## Jib - Container Images for Java Apps
					
					Build OCI images without docker Daemon.  
					Maven and Gradle plugins integrate to existing tool stack.

					```yaml [7|8|9-13]
					package-docker:
						docker:
						- image: cimg/openjdk:17.0-browsers
						- run:
							name: Package Docker image with Jib
							command: |
								./mvnw compile jib:build \
								-B -DskipTests=true \
								-Dbuild.number=<<pipeline.number>> \
								-Dcommit.hash=${CIRCLE_SHA1} \
								-Dcircle.workflow.guid=${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID} \
								-Dbuild.user=${CIRCLE_PROJECT_USERNAME} \
								-Dbuild.repo=${CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME} 
					```

					--

					## Build Info (with Maven)
					
					We capture environment info and pass it to maven at build time. We can expose this later from our running container!

					```xml [3,10-14]
					<configuration>
						<to>
							<image>registry.hub.docker.com/eddiewebb/blueskygreenbuilds-demo:b${build.number}</image>
						</to>
						<from>
							<image>openjdk:17-alpine</image>
						</from>
						<container>
							<jvmFlags>
								<jvmFlag>-Dbuild.number=${build.number}</jvmFlag>
								<jvmFlag>-Dcommit.hash=${commit.hash}</jvmFlag>
								<jvmFlag>-Dbuild.user=${build.user}</jvmFlag>
								<jvmFlag>-Dbuild.repo=${build.repo}</jvmFlag>
								<jvmFlag>-Dcircle.workflow.guid=${circle.workflow.guid}</jvmFlag>
							</jvmFlags>
						</container>
					```
					
					--

					## K8s cluster on EKS

					- Using ELB domain pointing to cluster
					- Contour handles ELB connections, routing to right service
					- CircleCI uses a Service Account to access the cluster 

					```bash [2-4|1|6|5|7-8|9]
					echo ${SERVER_CERT_CA} | base64 -d > ca.crt
					kubectl config set-cluster se-demo-eks-VlSWt4Kt \
					  --server=https://k8s-api-host.tld \
					  --certificate-authority=ca.crt
					export DECODED_TOKEN=$(echo ${SE_DEMO_CLUSTER_CCI_USER_TOKEN} | base64 -d)
					kubectl config set-credentials eddies-bot --token=${DECODED_TOKEN}
					kubectl config set-context cci --user=eddies-bot --namespace=eddie --cluster=se-demo-eks-VlSWt4Kt
					kubectl config use-context cci
					# see vamp/make-service-account.sh
					```

				# Vamp Deep Dive

				Walkthrough the Vamp agent, applications, policies, etc

				--

				## Vamp Release agent

				Firstly, there is not direct trigger or API call to vamp. 
				
				With the Vamp release agent we essentially hand ingress control to Vamp.  The cluster installed binary communicates with Vamp Cloud to shape traffic based on detected deployments.

				![visual of vamp agent on network](assets/vampoverview.png)

				--

				## Vamp - Application

				An *Application* represents the tuple of (Cluster, Namespace, Ingress) 

				You may think of Application as more of a Platform - it is not a specific web-service, UI, or function, but rather everything available behind a single domain.

				[BlueSKyGreenBuild App in Vamp](https://vamp.cloud/6/application/211/0)

				--

				## Vamp - Services

				A *Service* reprsents an individual web service or application running as a deployment, responsing on a specific path, and many may live in an Application

				https://vamp.cloud/6/application/211/0/services

				--

				## Vamp - Policies & Metrics

				Metrics are queries against prometheus essnetially.

				Policies are which metrics (beyond required health & availability) are used over a fixed time or request volume to assess validity of change.
				- 90% of responses < 500ms
				- 1,000 requests/min of traffic
				- No more than 2 restarts

					## The Toys (Demo sugar)

					To demonstrate the load balancing, metrics and other attributes, the sample app & cluster have some demo candy.

					--

					- [custom domain](http://blueskygreenbuilds.com) routes to AWS ELB
					- Exposing custom metrics @ [`/actuator`](http://blueskygreenbuilds.com/actuator) including JMX, traces and prometheus summary
					- Exposing build & pod info on a [`/build-info`](http://blueskygreenbuilds.com/build-info) endpoint
					- Webhooks in Vamp trigger conditional cleanup workflow in CCI
					- Contour exposes a .png of routing 
					- We can browse prometheus from local using port tunneling

					--

					### Build info

					Talk to governance, traceability, debuggability and fun with load balancers.  Each running instance exposes version and instance info.

					![json output showing version, IP, workflow ID and commit hash](assets/buildinfo.png)
					
					--

					### Load balancers?!
					Well, ingress controllers technically, but yeah!

					The config your define in Vamp configures the Contour ingress controller behind your domain. 
					This means during deployment we can see the version (buildnum) bounce back and forth as we reload.

					![dag of Contour ingress paths](assets/contouringress.png)
